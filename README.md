#Codename One Data Utilities

> A utilitiy library for Codename One for managing data conversions.

This library is intended to be used along with the [Codename One Reflection Utilities Project](https://github.com/shannah/cn1-mirah-json-macros).  This library provides a set of APIs for assisting with data conversions, such as JSON parsing, and reflection.  However, the classes and interfaces in this package are mostly abstract and require concrete instances to manually created (which is tedious) or for you to use mirah macros defined in the   [Codename One Reflection Utilities Project](https://github.com/shannah/cn1-mirah-json-macros) to generate concrete instances for you.
